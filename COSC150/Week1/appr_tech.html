<hr>

<p>

This question is easily bogged down in "what constitutes appropriate 
education?".  But it is important to remember that speech, the printing
press, and graphite on paper are often the appropriate choice.  

<p>

The point
is that, just as in our everyday lives working, playing, and learning
involves a combination of technologies, we should expect to see a similar
mixture work for education.  What do <i>you</i> use when you 
need to learn something?  The internet, the library, the yellow pages,
a friend, a colleague,
a computer, your brain, etc.  

<p>

Our hope is to help people see, not how 
they can use a computer to solve every problem in life, but how 
computational and communications technology fit into your problem solving
arsenal.
