<ul>
<li> Enable the teacher to teach
with professional competence and confidence by providing sufficient
background information and links to further resources including 
<ul>
<li>lesson plans
<li>classroom scenarios
<li>supplementary activities
<li>technology enhanced explorations
<li>mentors, colleagues, experts
</ul>
<p>

<li> The courseware must be based on standards (NCTM, NSES, Core Knowledge, State-specific), rather than tied
solely to a specific text.  
<p>

This will enable the courseware to overcome
any shortcomings in a given text while giving the greatest
likelihood to be of use beyond the schools' current text choice.  
<p>

<li> The courseware must be adaptable to specific classroom and student
situations (significant grayware requirement!)
<p>

Computers break, students have various interest in specific topics,
networks fail,<!--unless they are designed by Mark--> and the future
comes quickly.  The best way to adapt to such uncertainty is diversity and
modularity, and this should be reflected in the courseware and instilled
in the teacher.  <p>

</ul>
