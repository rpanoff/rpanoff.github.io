<h1>
summing up
</h1>
<h3>
<h2>The plan:</h2>
Develop a template consisting of
<ul>
<li>an authentic simulation
<li>embedded, hypertext support materials
<li>lesson ideas linked to national standards and dodds curriculum
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>What really happened:</h2>
<ul>
<li>template was developed
<li>template was modified and iterated
<li>template was modified and iterated...
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Bad news, good news, and things we already knew</h2>
(or, "lessons learned and repeated")
<ul>
<li>Goals of these simulations are inherently problematic...
<p>
Authentic => tough--both the background knowledge and the simulation itself

<li>...so you need all the other factors to work
<ul>
<li>TTT
<ul>
<li>gotta have time to train both software and content
<li>gotta have good communication, hardware, software, and grayware
</ul>
<li>Y,bwdIdT?s
<br>wasn't (arguably wouldn't need to be) a deliverable originally, but seemed like a good idea
</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>
Playing the hand you're dealt and liking it
</h2>
How do you compensate for reduced face to face training time?
<ul>
<li>embedded the application in the explanation rather than other way around
<li>Intermoo!
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>
Neat stuff that happened
</h2>
<ul>
<li>repeat of supercomputing center phenomenon
<li>really, truly integrated different tools--"object economy" etc.
<li>future looks really cool now
</ul>
<h2>
Some artifacts...
