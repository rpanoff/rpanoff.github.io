Avenues of Publication</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>The Shodor Education Foundation, Inc.
<p>
The dissemination of this type of material is a principal mission of the
foundation
<p>
<li>Glencoe
<p>An obvious win because of close ties to their existing curriculum
<p>
<li>Other publishers
<p>
Because our goal is compliance with any NCTM Standards-based curriculum,
our materials should appeal to a wide variety of publishers.  With very little
additional effort, once the materials have been developed, the presentation 
could be adapted to fit seamlessly into existing and future Standards-based 
curricula.
